# Brainy Quote Crawler

This is an adapted code from https://github.com/Hemil96/Brainyquote-API

It gets all quotes of all categories, which are relevant for our project:

- https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/topics/climber-quotes.html
- https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/topics/mountaineering-quotes.html
- https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/topics/mountain-quotes.html
- https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/topics/ski-quotes.html
- https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/topics/hike-quotes.html

They afterwards get stored in https://github.com/ThePickwickClub/mountain-fever/blob/main/data/quotes/quotes.csv
