You have to be careful of social climbers. There are a lot of potholes out there.,Ian Ziering

The best climber is the one who has the most fun.,Alex Lowe
When I lost seven of my toes on Nanga Parbat and small parts of my fingertips I knew I'd never be a great rock climber. So I specialized in high-altitude climbing.,Reinhold Messner

"I feel like an old-fashioned mountain climber when I am making discoveries, seeing something for the first time, realizing that no human before me has ever seen what I am seeing. It takes your breath away - for just a moment, you feel a pause in time, as you know you are crossing a boundary into a new realm of knowledge.",Heidi Hammel
"I know I'm not a cutting-edge free climber. Free soloing, I'm comfortable to 5.10-plus or 5.11a. But if I was a grade higher I could do some amazing things.",Dean Potter
"I adhere to my exercise program, which is about 20 minutes a day. I do it seven days a week. I have a little stall in the breezeway of our garage where I have a walking machine, a stair climber, and I do 15 pound weights, and I watch television. Because I hate exercise.",Dick Clark
"In climbing, sponsors typically support an athlete but provide very little direction, giving the climber free rein to follow his or her passion toward whatever is inspiring. It's a wonderful freedom, in many ways similar to that of an artist who simply lives his life and creates whatever moves him.",Alex Honnold
There is something addictive in space that makes you want to go back - like the mountain climbers who want to go back to the Himalayas although their fingers were cut by frostbite.,Yi So-Yeon

"I don't mind being called snobbish, a pain and a social climber, but being called unkind really hurts.",Rachel Johnson

My mother and father met through climbing and it was totally natural that I would become a climber too.,Adam Ondra
"When I was a teenager, I did a lot of pull-ups and push-ups. Every night before bed, I'd do 150 - in sets of 30 or so. Looking back on it now, I'm not totally sure that's the best way to improve as a climber. But it did make me a lot better at doing pull-ups and push-ups.",Alex Honnold
"I think speed climbing is kind of an artificial discipline. Climbers compete on the same holds and train on the same holds, which doesn't have much in common with the climbing philosophy in my opinion.",Adam Ondra

"The mission of professional mountain climbers is almost impossibly difficult by design: Their very livelihood is based on achieving the unprecedented. Their expeditions are complicated, exhausting, often life-threatening. Risk is the fuel that keeps them going.",Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi

Albert Frederick Mummery and Chris Bonington are the British climbers I most admire.,Reinhold Messner
"Out of all the climbers of this generation, I was the one who became known to the larger public. Many of them - not all of them, but many of them - understood they had only one chance to use me for their personal gain. And it's very easy to use me.",Reinhold Messner
"A 30-year-old rock climber is an old man. At 40, one is in the middle of his high-altitude power. At 50, a crosser of deserts is at his best age. But at 60, each of us is out of the game.",Reinhold Messner
"I became famous for the fact that I would break many, many limits. People said, 'He does all these crazy things.'

"The best climbers no longer go to the 8000ers, but to the most difficult mountains in the world which are 6000 or 7000-meter-peaks. There they find any kind of playground. But it is a pity that the really good climbers have fewer opportunities to finance their expeditions because so much attention is taken away by the Everest tourists.",Reinhold Messner
"For years I was a rock climber and nothing else. I went to school, yes, and university, yes, but in my heart I was a rock climber.",Reinhold Messner
Hunters get lost all the time. There's just an outcry against climbers because a lot of people don't understand climbers and they think they're crazy.,Jeff Lowe
"In 'The Prophet,' Kahlil Gibran says something about perfection only being reached by stripping something to the point of nakedness. That's the ultimate project: the naked climber doing the greatest climb.",Dean Potter
I consider myself a rock climber but the definition of rock climbing as has changed.,Dean Potter
"I also know for a fact of at least two other ascents of the Delicate Arch. But when 'Outside' did their research, the other two climbers wouldn't admit to it, and I admit to it because I don't see anything wrong with a man climbing a rock.",Dean Potter
"I'm not a great technical climber, but over the years it has given me the opportunity to see wonderful corners of Britain that I wouldn't have been able to experience any other way.",Steve Backshall
Life's a bit like mountaineering - never look down.,Edmund Hillary
"There are three elements of mountaineering - difficulty, danger, and exposure. Difficulty is the technical aspect of it.

Mountaineering has always been a huge hobby of mine.,Andy Serkis

"Nothing to mountaineering, just a little physical endurance, a good deal of brains, lots of practice, and plenty of warm clothing.",Annie Smith Peck
"Mountaineering is one of the most difficult sports - we are away from routine life for days, living in tents, and it requires high degree of physical and mental strength.",Samina Baig
"Look, I do not control alpinism. But maybe I was too successful. Many in the mountaineering scene - journalists, second-rate climbers, lecturers, so-called historians - had a problem with me for many years.",Reinhold Messner
"I really haven't liked the commercialization of mountaineering, particularly of Mt. Everest. By paying $65,000, you can be conducted to the summit by a couple of good guides.",Edmund Hillary
"Abundant choice doesn't force us to look for the absolute best of everything. It allows us to find the extremes in those things we really care about, whether that means great coffee, jeans cut wide across the hips, or a spouse who shares your zeal for mountaineering, Zen meditation, and science fiction.",Virginia Postrel
"My mountaineering skills are not important to my best photographs, but they do add a component to my work that is definitely a bit different than that of most photographers.",Galen Rowell

I don't know a lot about mountaineering. I once went walking in the Lake District with the legendary climber Chris Bonington and had to have emergency physio afterwards to regain sensation in my thighs.,Sandi Toksvig
"In climbing there is no question of right or wrong. Moral right or wrong, that is a religious question, they have nothing to do with anarchical activity, and classical mountaineering is a completely anarchical activity.",Reinhold Messner
"In mountaineering, there is not only the activity, but the philosophy behind it. Some say a moral, but I am against that because all morality is dangerous.",Reinhold Messner
This is one of my definitions of mountaineering: to go where others do not.,Reinhold Messner
"Over every mountain there is a path, although it may not be seen from the valley.",Theodore Roethke
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.,Edmund Hillary
"Earth and sky, woods and fields, lakes and rivers, the mountain and the sea, are excellent schoolmasters, and teach some of us more than we can ever learn from books.",John Lubbock

"Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain.",Richard M. Nixon

"I feel like I'm on top of the world. Honestly, I feel like I've climbed a very giant mountain, and I'm just standing right on top with my arms wide open and breathing rarified air.",Shania Twain

"Beauty is that little something that fills the whole world, and is contained neither in a single straight nose, a long eyelash, nor a blue mountain.

"The first 600 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, before you get into the Sierra Nevada mountain range, is heavy on desert. One of the things I carry with me in the desert is an umbrella.

"We spent a few days up Ben Nevis, which is the biggest mountain in the U.K., and there was one day when we had to make a decision whether we were going to go to the summit or not.
